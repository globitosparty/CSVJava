# Delete duplicity data in a csv

This script is easy to use, only execute script of public static void main and that's it!

**Caution**
- Make sure your names of a csv Files are correctly. You can change the name in the code if you prefer.
- The java version what I used was 1.8, and doesn't required external dependencies.
- I made 2 csv files like an example, you can execute the java project through the main to verify the example. 
- This script was probe with 80,000 data input and works fine delete around 70,000 duplicity data.
